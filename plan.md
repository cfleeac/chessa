# Transaction History Filter Panel - iPad Optimization Plan

## Test Cases for TDD Implementation

### Test 1: ✅ Filter Content Should Be Scrollable on iPad Portrait Mode
**Description**: When the filter panel is opened on iPad in portrait mode (768px width), the filter content should be scrollable to access all filter options.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Filter panel should display all 8 filter sections
- Content should be scrollable when it exceeds viewport height
- ScrollArea component should be used for smooth scrolling
- Scroll indicators should be visible when content overflows

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Wrap filter sections in ScrollArea component
- Set appropriate height constraints for iPad portrait (768px x 1024px)
- Ensure touch-friendly scrolling behavior

---

### Test 2: ✅ Action Buttons Should Remain Sticky at Bottom on iPad
**Description**: The "Reset All" and "Apply Filters" buttons should always remain visible and accessible at the bottom of the filter panel, regardless of scroll position.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Action buttons are always visible at the bottom of the panel
- Buttons should not scroll with the filter content
- Clear visual separation between scrollable content and buttons
- Buttons should remain functional when content is scrolled

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Create separate footer section for action buttons
- Use sticky positioning or fixed layout structure
- Add visual separator (border or shadow) between content and buttons

---

### Test 3: ✓ Filter Panel Should Handle iPad Landscape Mode
**Description**: When iPad is rotated to landscape mode (1024px width), the filter panel should adapt appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Panel width should adjust appropriately for landscape orientation
- All content should fit comfortably without unnecessary scrolling
- Action buttons should remain at bottom
- Better space utilization in landscape mode

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Responsive height calculations based on orientation
- Adjust panel width for landscape mode if needed
- Optimize spacing for wider screens

---

### Test 4: ScrollArea Should Handle Variable Content Heights
**Description**: The scrollable area should adapt to different amounts of filter content and varying screen heights.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ScrollArea should work with minimum content (few filters)
- ScrollArea should work with maximum content (all filters expanded)
- Proper height calculations for different screen sizes
- No unnecessary scrollbars when content fits

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Dynamic height calculation: `calc(100vh - header - footer - padding)`
- Minimum and maximum height constraints
- Proper overflow handling

---

### Test 5: Touch Interactions Should Work Properly on iPad
**Description**: All filter interactions should work smoothly with touch input on iPad.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Smooth scrolling with touch gestures
- All filter controls (dropdowns, inputs, date pickers) work with touch
- Action buttons are touch-friendly (adequate size and spacing)
- No interference between scroll gestures and filter interactions

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Ensure proper touch event handling
- Adequate touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
- Proper scroll momentum and bounce effects

---

### Test 6: ✅ Filter Panel Should Maintain Existing Functionality
**Description**: All existing filter functionality should continue to work after the iPad optimization.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 8 filter types work correctly
- Filter state is preserved during scrolling
- Apply and Reset buttons function as before
- No regression in filter logic or API calls

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Preserve all existing event handlers
- Maintain state management logic
- Ensure no breaking changes to filter operations

---

## Implementation Notes

- Use shadcn-ui ScrollArea component for consistent styling
- Follow existing design patterns and color schemes
- Test on actual iPad devices if possible, or use browser dev tools with iPad dimensions
- Ensure accessibility standards are maintained
- Consider performance implications of scrollable content
